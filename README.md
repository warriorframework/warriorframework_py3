Warrior Framework is an open source automation framework designed to enable anyone to automate their testing, processes, and repetitive tasks by simplifying the complex process of building an automation infrastructure. As a keyword and data driven framework, Warrior’s infrastructure is built to maximize on re-usability of  built in keywords. In addition, Warrior’s app based platform provides the users with native apps to easily implement their automation needs, while providing the user with the ability to customize their own workflow apps.

#### Clone warriorframework

We strongly recommend getting the latest released version.

###### Get the Repository
`git clone https://github.com/warriorframework/warriorframework_py3.git`

###### Go into warriorframework_py3 Directory
`cd warriorframework_py3`

###### Get List of Versions Available
`git tag --list" command`

Output:

`warrior-4.0.0-beta`<br/>
`warrior-3.4.0`<br/>
`warrior-3.3.0` <br/>
`warrior-3.2.0`<br/>

###### Check the Current Version You Are At
`git branch`

Output:

`\* master`<br/>
`\* indicates the active version.`<br/>
`In the above example master is the active version.`<br/>
`If the active version is master it means you are not using a standard release version of warriorframework and hence it may not be a stable tested version.`<br/>

###### Get A Specific Version from master
`git checkout warrior-3.4.0`

Output:

`Note: checking out 'warrior-3.4.0'.`

`You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.`

`If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:`

`git checkout -b new_branch_name`

`HEAD is now at 2bba292... Merge pull request #234 from warriorframework/release-warrior-3.4.0`

###### Verify the Active Version. <br/>
`git branch`

Output:

`\* (HEAD detached at warrior-3.4.0)` <br/>
`master` <br/>

`\* indicates the active version.`

###### Switch Versions (Eg: current=warrior-3.4.0, switch to warrior-4.0.0-beta) <br/>

`git checkout warrior-4.0.0-beta`

Output:

`Previous HEAD position was 2bba292... Merge pull request #234 from warriorframework/release-warrior-3.4.0`<br/>
`HEAD is now at b3bad2e... Update version.txt`


##### Running WarriorFramework Locally

Once, you have WarriorFramework on your system, cd into the katana directory:

`cd warriorframework_py3/katana`

Then, run the command to kickstart the server:

`python Katana.py runserver`

Make sure that your are using the correct Python. The command above will start the server on port 8000 by default. If you want to start the server on a different port (say, 5000), you can modify the command above to this:

`python Katana.py runserver 0.0.0.0:5000`

Then, open up a browser and type in the following as a URL:

`localhost:8000/katana/`

If you are usng a different port (say, 5000), change the url above to use that port:

`localhost:5000/katana/`

WarriorFramework is now up and running.
