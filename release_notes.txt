3. Procedure to install pip module
=================================================

1.Latest version warriorframework from PyPI server
    pip install warriorframework

2.Specfic Version warriorframework from PyPI Server
    pip install warriorframework==4.3.0

3. Uninstall warriorframework

=============================================================
4. Procedure to get a specific version of Warrior from github
==============================================================

1. Clone warriorframework

	$ git clone https://github.com/warriorframework/warriorframework_py3.git

2. Goto warriorframework directory

	$cd warriorframework

3. To check the list of versions available, execute "git tag --list" command

    $ git tag --list
    warior-4.3.0


4. To Check the current version you are at, execute "git branch" command

    $ git branch
        * master
        - * indicates the active version.
        - In the above example master is the active version.
        - If the active version is master it means you are not using a standard release version of warrior framework and hence it may
          not be a stable tested version.

5. To switch to a specific version from master, execute 'git checkout <version_name>' command.

    $ git checkout warrior-4.3.0
        Note: checking out 'warrior-4.3.0'.

        You are in 'detached HEAD' state. You can look around, make experimental
        changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this
        state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.

        If you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may
        do so (now or later) by using -b with the checkout command again. Example:

        git checkout -b <new-branch-name>

        HEAD is now at 146313d... reduce command timeout, wait after timeout=60


6. Execute git branch command to verify the active version.

    $ git branch
        * (HEAD detached at warrior-4.3.0)
        master
        - * indicates the active version.
